## Motivation
Coastal lagoons represent fragile ecosystems of great value to the scientific community and ecologists. These unique environments are in danger due to their high sensitivity to environmental changes. Even minimal alterations in lagoon conditions, such as hydrology, salinity, nutrients, and temperature, can trigger significant changes in biological community composition and diversity.

Climate change further exacerbates this situation. Rising sea levels contribute to the loss of coastal ecosystem extent and increased lagoon salinity, while global warming favors thermophilic species, displacing native species and reducing biodiversity. Therefore, coastal lagoons are increasingly threatened, leading to their classification as a priority habitat of community interest by the Habitats Directive.

There are two types of disturbances in natural ecosystems classified according to their intensity and persistence over time. These disturbances can be 'Pulsatile,' sudden and of high intensity, such as floods; or 'Press', continous and less intense, such as chemical spills and industrial waste. The effect of these disturbances varies depending on their nature and the resilience of the affected ecosystem. Resilience is directly related to ecosystem complexity: the greater the species diversity and richness, the more stable the community structure and the more regulatory mechanisms available.

As long as the community structure is complex enough, pulsatile disturbances are usually not as impactful, and can even be beneficial if they are seasonal. In contrast, continuous disturbances, even if weak, if sufficiently persistent over time, can completely transform the community structure, leading the lagoon to a eutrophic state and favoring the dominance of opportunistic species, resulting in biodiversity loss.

In the specific case of the lagoons of Alt Empordà, periods of flooding and confinement are observed, influencing the composition of the community structure. This pulsatile disturbance triggers an ecological succession in four levels, where different species dominate the habitat depending on environmental conditions.

Initially, the environment experiences a rapid increase in nutrients, facilitating the proliferation of Synchaetta spp. (small organisms with a high reproduction rate under favorable conditions). Then, as nutrients become depleted, cyclopoids begin to dominate, maintaining dominance if there is a continuous flow of nutrients of low intensity. Otherwise, they are replaced by calanoids. Finally, only in very confined lagoons, depending on whether the conditions are eutrophic, oligotrophic, or intermediate, Brachionus plicatilis, Odessia maeotica, and Gammarus aequicauda become dominant, respectively.

## Goals
The main objective of the project is to understand the impact of different disturbances on the resilience of coastal ecosystems and the response of biological communities to these changes. It also aims to investigate the self-regulation mechanisms of ecosystems in response to these disturbances.

Specifically, the project aims to:
- Evaluate the effect of pulsatile and continuous disturbances, as well as their simultaneous combination, on the composition and structure of the aquatic community network of zooplankton in a coastal, brackish, and shallow lagoon located in the wetlands of La Pletera, in the Alt Empordà.
- Understand the dynamics of the zooplankton community in the La Pletera wetlands and its vulnerabilities to different types of disturbances.
- Provide relevant information for the development of more accurate conservation strategies aimed at protecting these habitats and their communities from potential future disturbances.

## Methodology
### Experimental design
This study is based on an experiment conducted by the EcoAqua research group (EcoAqua (SGR 548), 2017), aimed at evaluating the response of the aquatic community network of zooplankton in a Mediterranean coastal lagoon to various disturbances.

For this purpose, different treatments were established:
- Control (O): In this treatment, no nutrients were added to compare differences between treatments with and without nutrients.
- Continuous (C): Nutrients were added daily to the water to simulate continuous disturbances or "press".
- Pulsatile (P): This treatment simulated pulsatile disturbances by adding nutrients once at the beginning of the experiment (day 0 of sampling).
- Pulsatile-Continuous Combination (PC): A treatment combining a lower-magnitude pulsatile disturbance with a continuous one, both of lower concentration. Half of the total nutrient concentration (P/2) was added on day 0 of sampling, and the other half was distributed over subsequent sampling days.

With a total of 5 replicates, the study evaluates various parameters in water samples, such as ions, inorganic nutrients, alkalinity, water isotopes, among others. However, we focus solely on analyzing the response of zooplankton to different disturbances, through the analysis of changes in its abundance and composition.

The experiment extended for almost 1 month, with periodic sampling on days: -3 (mesocosm installation), 0 (first day of nutrient addition [C and PC], unique to [C]), 1, 5, 11, 18, and 24.
