Coastal lagoons represent fragile ecosystems of great value to the scientific community and ecologists. These unique environments are in danger due to their high sensitivity to environmental changes. Even minimal alterations in lagoon conditions, such as hydrology, salinity, nutrients, and temperature, can trigger significant changes in biological community composition and diversity.

Climate change further exacerbates this situation. Rising sea levels contribute to the loss of coastal ecosystem extent and increased lagoon salinity, while global warming favors thermophilic species, displacing native species and reducing biodiversity. Therefore, coastal lagoons are increasingly threatened, leading to their classification as a priority habitat of community interest by the Habitats Directive.

There are two types of disturbances in natural ecosystems classified according to their intensity and persistence over time. These disturbances can be 'Pulsatile,' sudden and of high intensity, such as floods; or 'Press', continous and less intense, such as chemical spills and industrial waste. The effect of these disturbances varies depending on their nature and the resilience of the affected ecosystem. Resilience is directly related to ecosystem complexity: the greater the species diversity and richness, the more stable the community structure and the more regulatory mechanisms available.

Press/Pulse disturbances

As long as the community structure is complex enough, pulsatile disturbances are usually not as impactful, and can even be beneficial if they are seasonal. In contrast, continuous disturbances, even if weak, if sufficiently persistent over time, can completely transform the community structure, leading the lagoon to a eutrophic state and favoring the dominance of opportunistic species, resulting in biodiversity loss.

In the specific case of the lagoons of Alt Empordà, periods of flooding and confinement are observed, influencing the composition of the community structure. This pulsatile disturbance triggers an ecological succession in four levels, where different species dominate the habitat depending on environmental conditions.

Initially, the environment experiences a rapid increase in nutrients, facilitating the proliferation of Synchaetta spp. (small organisms with a high reproduction rate under favorable conditions). Then, as nutrients become depleted, cyclopoids begin to dominate, maintaining dominance if there is a continuous flow of nutrients of low intensity. Otherwise, they are replaced by calanoids. Finally, only in very confined lagoons, depending on whether the conditions are eutrophic, oligotrophic, or intermediate, Brachionus plicatilis, Odessia maeotica, and Gammarus aequicauda become dominant, respectively.

## Goals
The main objective of the project is to understand the impact of different disturbances on the resilience of coastal ecosystems and the response of biological communities to these changes. It also aims to investigate the self-regulation mechanisms of ecosystems in response to these disturbances.

Specifically, the project aims to:
- Evaluate the effect of pulsatile and continuous disturbances, as well as their simultaneous combination, on the composition and structure of the aquatic community network of zooplankton in a coastal, brackish, and shallow lagoon located in the wetlands of La Pletera, in the Alt Empordà.
- Understand the dynamics of the zooplankton community in the La Pletera wetlands and its vulnerabilities to different types of disturbances.
- Provide relevant information for the development of more accurate conservation strategies aimed at protecting these habitats and their communities from potential future disturbances.

## Methodology
### Experimental design
This study is based on an experiment conducted by the EcoAqua research group (EcoAqua (SGR 548), 2017), aimed at evaluating the response of the aquatic community network of zooplankton in a Mediterranean coastal lagoon to various disturbances.

For this purpose, different treatments were established:
- Control (O): In this treatment, no nutrients were added to compare differences between treatments with and without nutrients.
- Continuous (C): Nutrients were added daily to the water to simulate continuous disturbances or "press".
- Pulsatile (P): This treatment simulated pulsatile disturbances by adding nutrients once at the beginning of the experiment (day 0 of sampling).
- Pulsatile-Continuous Combination (PC): A treatment combining a lower-magnitude pulsatile disturbance with a continuous one, both of lower concentration. Half of the total nutrient concentration (P/2) was added on day 0 of sampling, and the other half was distributed over subsequent sampling days.

With a total of 5 replicates, the study evaluates various parameters in water samples, such as ions, inorganic nutrients, alkalinity, water isotopes, among others. However, we focus solely on analyzing the response of zooplankton to different disturbances, through the analysis of changes in its abundance and composition.

The experiment extended for almost 1 month, with periodic sampling on days: -3 (mesocosm installation), 0 (first day of nutrient addition [C and PC], unique to [C]), 1, 5, 11, 18, and 24.

### Data analysis and processing
Firstly, data need to be balanced, ensuring that each mesocosm has observations both at the beginning (02/03/2020) and at the end of the experiment (29/03/2020), thus ensuring that the dataset is paired according to the sampling date. Biomass of different individuals is calculated using formulas that vary depending on the taxonomic group, based on the length and/or width of each individual. Only a few individuals of each taxon were measured, and the remaining measurements were extrapolated. Additionally, data are standardized to the same proportions since each measurement was taken from different sample volumes and dilutions.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) allows for the reduction of the number of studied variables (dimensionality), minimizing the loss of variability and facilitating data interpretation. Principal components, resulting from the linear combination of the original variables, are generated. These components are independent (orthogonal), thus avoiding information redundancy. Two types of PCA plots are used: PCA Scalling 1, suitable for studying objects (mesocosms in our case), and PCA Scalling 2, for studying the relationship between variables (species). PCA Scalling 1 has been selected, prioritizing the preservation of Euclidean distances of the objects relative to the original matrix, although it may lose accuracy in the angles of the variables represented as arrows.

Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) examines the influence of one or more factors (categorical variables) on a response variable (continuous variable), analyzing the differences between the means of the response variable with respect to each of the factors (or groups). Assumptions of normality, homoscedasticity, and randomness must be met. Multifactorial ANOVA will be performed to study the structure of the zooplankton community, investigating whether abundance, richness, and taxonomic diversity vary according to the treatments used and the sampling date (initial and final).

Before conducting ANOVA, a linear model is created to analyze the different parameters according to treatment and date, and to verify compliance with homogeneity and normality assumptions using Levene's and Shapiro-Wilk tests, respectively. For abundance and richness, data transformation using natural logarithm was necessary to achieve data normality.

## Results and conclusions
### PCA
In the PCA analysis, the first axis (PC1) explains 23.9% of variability, while PC2 explains 15.7%, representing nearly 40% of the total variability. According to the interpretation of the first pair of principal component axes, in the graph, we can identify three main groups of objects closely related to each other and with certain variables:

The first group (blue) includes all initial observations and one final observation (O4f). These objects are closely related to each other and predominantly consist of Cyclopodia nauplii, Harpacticoida nauplii, Synchaeta spp., Calanoida copepods, and ostracods.

The second group (red) consists of treatments with nutrient addition, whether pulsatile, continuous, or their combination. That is, all final observations not belonging to treatment O. There is a higher biomass of ostracod larvae, Scuticociliata, Chironomidae larvae, Brachionus plicatilis, and Cyclopodia copepods. This group is also relatively close to the taxa Hexarthra spp., Harpacticoida copepods, and Calanoida nauplii, indicating a significant abundance of these taxa as well.

Samples from the third group (green) are characterized by higher biomass of Cyclopoida copepods + eggs, Calanoida copepods + eggs, mixotrophic ciliates, and Gammarus aequicauda. Similar to the previous group, these samples are also relatively close to the taxa Hexarthra spp., Harpacticoida copepods, and Calanoida nauplii, suggesting a certain abundance of these taxa as well. Basically, these samples correspond to the Control treatment (O) sampled at the end of the experiment.

### ANOVA
A significant interaction has been observed regarding the natural logarithm of individual abundance concerning the treatment applied and the sampling date. However, there is a lack of significance in the interaction (treatment:date). As can be seen in the graphical analysis, it is evident that abundance varies depending on the date, and it is also noticeable that it varies depending on the treatment. However, it does not seem that the variations in abundance between the initial and final samples differ according to the treatment applied.

A significant interaction has been observed in all combinations of ANOVA (treatment | date | treatment:date), both for the analysis of abundance and taxonomic richness. This indicates that both abundance and richness vary depending on the treatment used and the sampling date; furthermore, the variations between the initial and final samples differ depending on the treatment applied in both cases.

### Discussion
The results indicate that the taxonomic diversity of the initial samples, before applying any treatment (blue group), was abnormally low: they exhibited a Shannon-Weaver specific diversity index H=0.19, when a value close to 1 was expected according to (Badosa et al., 2006).

We observe a very well-defined group consisting of those samples to which nutrients were injected (red), clearly differentiated from the other groups, confirming that any nutrient injection affects the direction that the community structure would take under normal conditions.

The fact that the community structure varies without employing any treatment suggests that there must be some regulating element that was not taken into account in the experiment, probably involving a pattern of plankton successions common in similar habitats.

The findings that the initial samplings indicate low diversity and the presence of organisms at each succession level (Synchaeta, Cyclopodia, Calanoida, and Harpacticoida), as well as the significant increase in biodiversity in the final control samples and their containing only the last 3 succession states, indicate that shortly before the experiment preparation, a flood may have occurred, triggering the observed succession pattern.

The pulsatile treatment is the one that has most affected the aquatic community network, hindering the growth of abundance, richness, and taxonomic diversity. In fact, these parameters have hardly varied compared to the initial samples, contrary to the trend of growth in the other treatments. The biodiversity of the samples is not high enough, nor is the community structure complex and stratified enough to present sufficient resilience to withstand these pulsatile disturbances.

The continuous treatment, although not as much as in the case of the pulsatile one, has also resulted in a notable reduction in the increase of individual abundance and taxonomic richness and diversity compared to the control.

This is not the case for the pulsatile + continuous treatment, where abnormal increases in richness and taxonomic diversity are observed, even greater than those of the control. This could be due to the fact that the concentration of the pulsatile part of the treatment has not been sufficient to restart the succession chain, and that the concentration of the continuous part has been low enough to sustain organism diversity without harming the community structure.
