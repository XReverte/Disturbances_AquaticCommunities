## Motivation
Coastal lagoons represent fragile ecosystems of great value to the scientific community and ecologists. These unique environments are in danger due to their high sensitivity to environmental changes. Even minimal alterations in lagoon conditions, such as hydrology, salinity, nutrients, and temperature, can trigger significant changes in biological community composition and diversity.

Climate change further exacerbates this situation. Rising sea levels contribute to the loss of coastal ecosystem extent and increased lagoon salinity, while global warming favors thermophilic species, displacing native species and reducing biodiversity. Therefore, coastal lagoons are increasingly threatened, leading to their classification as a priority habitat of community interest by the Habitats Directive.

There are two types of disturbances in natural ecosystems classified according to their intensity and persistence over time. These disturbances can be 'pulsatile,' sudden and of high intensity, such as floods, or 'continuous' and less intense, such as chemical spills and industrial waste. The effect of these disturbances varies depending on their nature and the resilience of the affected ecosystem. Resilience is directly related to ecosystem complexity: the greater the species diversity and richness, the more stable the community structure and the more regulatory mechanisms available.

As long as the community structure is complex enough, pulsatile disturbances are usually not as impactful, and can even be beneficial if they are seasonal. In contrast, continuous disturbances, even if weak, if sufficiently persistent over time, can completely transform the community structure, leading the lagoon to a eutrophic state and favoring the dominance of opportunistic species, resulting in biodiversity loss.

In the specific case of the lagoons of Alt Empordà, periods of flooding and confinement are observed, influencing the composition of the community structure. This pulsatile disturbance triggers an ecological succession in four levels, where different species dominate the habitat depending on environmental conditions.

Initially, the environment experiences a rapid increase in nutrients, facilitating the proliferation of Synchaetta spp. (small organisms with a high reproduction rate under favorable conditions). Then, as nutrients become depleted, cyclopoids begin to dominate, maintaining dominance if there is a continuous flow of nutrients of low intensity. Otherwise, they are replaced by calanoids. Finally, only in very confined lagoons, depending on whether the conditions are eutrophic, oligotrophic, or intermediate, Brachionus plicatilis, Odessia maeotica, and Gammarus aequicauda become dominant, respectively.
